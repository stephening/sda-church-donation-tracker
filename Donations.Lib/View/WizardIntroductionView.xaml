			<Paragraph>
				The primary application for this package is Donation-tracker.exe,
				which is a Windows desktop application designed to track donors and donations to tax-exempt organizations.
				It was actually designed with churches in mind.
				The Donation-tracker application uses a Microsoft SQL database for storing the data.
				The database can exist either on the same system the application is run from,
				or it can be maintained on a server accessible through the Internet.
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph>
				This wizard will ask a question up fron after which it will guide you through some steps toward setting up or connecting to a database.
				After successful connection to a database server, you can optionally create the database and tables.
				Then if you were able to export some data from your previous system, you may be able to, with a little massaging, import your data.
				There are three different tables that can be imported.
